# Delivery Standards (Enterprise Readiness & Completion)

Enterprise-grade delivery standards that define **when work is ready to start**
and **when work is considered complete**.

These standards exist to create consistency, predictability, quality,
and executive confidence across teams operating in complex and regulated environments.

Standards are not guidelines.  
They are **non-negotiable execution expectations**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish **shared delivery guardrails**
that enable predictable outcomes without micromanagement.

These standards ensure that:

- Teams do not start unready work
- Incomplete or low-quality work is not passed off as “done”
- Delivery signals are trustworthy
- Risk is surfaced early, not late
- Leadership can rely on reported progress

Without standards, Scrum becomes interpretive and unreliable.

---

## Core Standards Covered

This section defines enterprise expectations for:

- Definition of Ready (DoR)
- Definition of Done (DoD)
- Quality and compliance readiness
- Release and operational readiness
- Consistency across teams and programs

Each standard is designed to prevent known enterprise failure modes.

---

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready establishes the **minimum criteria** a backlog item
must meet before it can be pulled into a Sprint.

DoR exists to protect teams from:
- Ambiguous requirements
- Hidden dependencies
- Late-stage rework
- Planning failures

Work that does not meet DoR **must not be committed**.

Refer to `definition-of-ready.md` for detailed criteria.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done establishes the **minimum completion criteria**
required for work to be considered complete and potentially releasable.

DoD exists to ensure:
- Quality consistency
- Compliance adherence
- Reduction of rework and defects
- Reliable Sprint Reviews and release decisions

Work that does not meet DoD **is not Done**, regardless of effort spent.

Refer to `definition-of-done.md` for detailed criteria.

---

## Enterprise Quality Expectations

In enterprise environments, quality is not optional.

Delivery standards must account for:

- Non-functional requirements
- Security and compliance checks
- Performance and reliability expectations
- Documentation and audit readiness
- Operational and support considerations

Quality deferred becomes delivery risk.

---

## Release Readiness Standards

Release readiness is assessed continuously, not at the end.

Standards ensure that:

- Completed work can be released safely
- Risks are visible and understood
- Release decisions are evidence-based
- Partial or fragile solutions are not rushed

Sprint completion does not imply automatic release approval.

---

## Governance and Consistency

These standards apply across:

- Teams
- Products
- Programs
- Value streams

Tailoring is allowed only with **explicit agreement** and documented rationale.

Inconsistent standards create false signals and erode trust.

---

## Enforcement Expectations

Standards are enforced through:

- Sprint Planning (DoR enforcement)
- Sprint Review (DoD enforcement)
- Scrum Master discipline
- Product Owner accountability
- Leadership support when pressure arises

Standards that collapse under pressure were never standards.

---

## Common Enterprise Failure Modes Prevented

These standards exist to prevent:

- Teams starting work they do not understand
- Chronic Sprint carryover
- “Almost done” work accumulating
- Quality issues surfacing late
- Leadership distrust in delivery reporting

---

## Expected Outcomes

Organizations applying these standards consistently will observe:

- Improved delivery predictability
- Reduced rework and defect rates
- Stronger Sprint commitments
- Higher confidence in release decisions
- Clearer accountability across roles

---

## Relationship to Other Playbook Sections

Delivery standards work in conjunction with:

- `roles/` — accountability for enforcement
- `scrum-events/` — inspection and adaptation
- `facilitation-guides/` — execution discipline

Standards define **what is acceptable**.  
Events inspect compliance.  
Roles enforce accountability.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, standards protect teams and leadership alike.

When enforced consistently, they enable:
- Sustainable delivery
- Trustworthy signals
- Confident decision-making

When treated as optional, they become invisible—and failure follows.
