# Definition of Ready (DoR)

A backlog item is considered ready when it meets
the minimum criteria required for the team to
confidently pull it into a sprint.

## Readiness Criteria
- Business value is clearly articulated
- Acceptance criteria are defined
- Dependencies are identified
- Test approach is understood
- Item is appropriately sized for a sprint

## Guiding Principle
Items that do not meet the Definition of Ready
are not pulled into the sprint backlog.
