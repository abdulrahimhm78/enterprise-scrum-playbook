# Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready defines the **minimum, enforceable entry criteria**
required for a backlog item to be considered suitable for Sprint Planning
in an enterprise environment.

Work that does not meet the Definition of Ready **must not be pulled**
into a sprint, regardless of urgency or external pressure.

---

## Purpose

The Definition of Ready exists to:

- Protect Sprint commitments
- Reduce mid-sprint churn and scope changes
- Surface risks and dependencies early
- Enable realistic planning and forecasting
- Prevent teams from absorbing upstream uncertainty

Ready is a **planning gate**, not a suggestion.

---

## Readiness Criteria

A backlog item is considered **Ready** only when **all** of the following are true:

### Business Clarity
- Business value and intended outcome are clearly articulated
- The problem being solved is understood by the team
- Priority is agreed and visible

### Scope & Acceptance
- Acceptance criteria are defined and testable
- Success conditions are unambiguous
- Non-goals or exclusions are stated if applicable

### Dependencies & Risks
- Dependencies are identified and acknowledged
- External inputs required for delivery are available or committed
- Known risks are documented and discussed
- Assumptions are explicitly stated

### Technical Readiness
- Solution approach is broadly understood
- Architectural or design constraints are known
- No unresolved technical unknowns that would block execution

### Sizing & Sprint Fit
- Item is appropriately sized for a single sprint
- Work can be completed within sprint boundaries
- Splitting strategy is agreed if needed

### Test & Validation Approach
- Testing strategy is understood
- Acceptance validation approach is clear
- Required environments or data are available

---

## Guiding Principle

**If the team cannot confidently commit, the work is not Ready.**

Readiness protects the Sprint in the same way Done protects the Increment.

---

## Enforcement Expectations

The Definition of Ready is enforced through:

- Backlog refinement discipline
- Sprint Planning commitment checks
- Scrum Master facilitation
- Product Owner accountability
- Leadership support when work is deferred

Urgency does not override readiness.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns (Not Ready)

The following do **not** meet the Definition of Ready:

- “We will figure it out in the sprint”
- Missing or vague acceptance criteria
- Unconfirmed dependencies
- Over-sized stories
- Priority without clarity
- Stories added during planning without refinement

---

## Expected Outcomes

Consistent application of this DoR results in:

- More predictable sprint outcomes
- Fewer mid-sprint surprises
- Stronger team confidence
- Higher delivery quality
- Improved trust with stakeholders

---

## Relationship to Other Standards

This Definition of Ready works in conjunction with:

- `definition-of-done.md`
- `scrum-events/sprint-planning.md`
- `roles/product-owner.md`

Ready governs **what enters** the Sprint.  
Done governs **what exits** the Sprint.
