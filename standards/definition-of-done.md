# Definition of Done (DoD)

Work is considered done only when it meets
all agreed quality and completion criteria.

## Completion Criteria
- Acceptance criteria are met
- Code is reviewed and merged
- Tests are executed successfully
- Documentation is updated as needed
- Work is deployable or released per standards

## Guiding Principle
Done means usable, releasable, and supportable —
not partially complete.
