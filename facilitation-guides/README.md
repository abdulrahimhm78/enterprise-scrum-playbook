# Scrum Facilitation Guides (Enterprise)

Enterprise-grade facilitation standards for Scrum events, focused on
delivery outcomes, accountability, and execution discipline—not ceremony completion.

These guides define **how Scrum events should be prepared, facilitated, and evaluated**
in large-scale and regulated enterprise environments.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these facilitation guides is to ensure Scrum events:

- Drive delivery decisions
- Surface risks and dependencies early
- Reinforce accountability across roles
- Produce observable, actionable outcomes

Facilitation is treated as a **delivery leadership responsibility**, not a
meeting coordination function.

---

## Enterprise Facilitation Principles

All Scrum events facilitated using this playbook adhere to the following principles:

- Outcomes over attendance
- Preparation over improvisation
- Decisions over discussion
- Transparency over optimism
- Accountability over consensus

If an event does not change delivery behavior, it is considered ineffective.

---

## Events Covered

These guides define facilitation standards for the following Scrum events:

### Sprint Planning
- Capacity-based commitment setting
- Clear Definition of Ready enforcement
- Dependency and risk surfacing
- Sprint goal realism and alignment

### Daily Scrum
- Flow-focused inspection
- Blocker and risk identification
- Commitment tracking
- Avoidance of status reporting to Scrum Masters

### Sprint Review
- Increment validation against Definition of Done
- Stakeholder feedback tied to outcomes
- Release readiness signaling
- Delivery confidence assessment

### Sprint Retrospective
- Root-cause analysis over symptom discussion
- Action items tied to measurable improvement
- Ownership assignment and follow-up
- Avoidance of repetitive, low-impact themes

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

These facilitation standards explicitly correct common failure modes, including:

- Meetings without preparation
- Retrospectives without follow-through
- Sprint Planning driven by optimism instead of capacity
- Daily Scrums devolving into status updates
- Reviews treated as demos instead of validation checkpoints

---

## How These Guides Are Used

These facilitation guides are applied:

- When onboarding new Scrum teams
- During Scrum resets or maturity remediation
- When delivery predictability is degraded
- As part of audit or compliance readiness
- To standardize execution across multiple teams

Guides may be tailored, but **facilitation discipline is not optional**.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams using these facilitation standards should observe:

- Improved Sprint commitment reliability
- Earlier identification of delivery risks
- Higher-quality Retrospective outcomes
- Reduced ceremony fatigue
- Increased leadership confidence in delivery signals

---

## Relationship to Other Playbook Sections

These facilitation guides work in conjunction with:

- `roles/` — defines accountability expectations for facilitators
- `scrum-events/` — defines event-specific execution standards
- `standards/` — enforces readiness and completion criteria

Facilitation without standards is ineffective.  
Standards without facilitation are ignored.

---

## Usage Guidance

These guides are intended for:

- Senior Scrum Masters
- Agile Delivery Leads
- Engineering Managers facilitating Scrum events
- Transformation leaders establishing execution discipline

They are **not** intended for lightweight, informal, or ad-hoc Scrum implementations.

---

## Key Message

Scrum facilitation in enterprise environments is a **delivery control function**.

When done correctly, Scrum events become:
- Predictive
- Actionable
- Decision-enabling

When done poorly, they become overhead.

These guides exist to ensure the former.
