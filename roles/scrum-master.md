# Scrum Master (Enterprise Role Definition)

The Scrum Master in an enterprise environment is a **delivery leader** accountable
for the health, predictability, and execution discipline of the Scrum delivery system.

This role extends beyond facilitation to include governance enforcement,
systemic impediment removal, and enablement of reliable delivery outcomes.

---

## Accountability

The Scrum Master is accountable for:

- Delivery system health and stability
- Execution discipline across Scrum events
- Transparency and reliability of delivery signals
- Continuous improvement tied to measurable outcomes
- Escalation of systemic risks and impediments

The Scrum Master does **not** own delivery commitments, but **owns the conditions**
under which reliable commitments can be made and honored.

---

## Enterprise Responsibilities

In large-scale and regulated environments, the Scrum Master is responsible for:

- Enforcing Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD)
- Ensuring Scrum events produce decisions and outcomes
- Identifying and escalating cross-team dependencies
- Protecting teams from unmanaged work and scope injection
- Coaching Product Owners on backlog readiness and prioritization
- Partnering with Engineering leadership on capacity realism and quality
- Driving improvement actions to completion, not discussion

---

## Authority and Decision Rights

To be effective, the Scrum Master must have authority to:

- Enforce Scrum standards and operating rules
- Challenge unrealistic commitments
- Escalate impediments beyond the team boundary
- Require preparation for Scrum events
- Call out delivery risks early and visibly

Without authority, the role degrades into coordination and reporting.

---

## What This Role Is Not

The enterprise Scrum Master is **not**:

- A project administrator
- A task assigner
- A status reporter
- A meeting scheduler
- A proxy manager

If the Scrum Master is spending the majority of time tracking tasks or reporting
status, delivery accountability has already broken down.

---

## Success Indicators

A Scrum Master operating effectively in an enterprise environment will demonstrate:

- Improved Sprint predictability over time
- Reduced carryover and unplanned work
- Clear visibility into risks and dependencies
- High-quality Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives
- Observable follow-through on improvement actions
- Increased leadership trust in delivery signals

Team happiness alone is **not** a sufficient indicator of success.

---

## Common Enterprise Failure Modes Addressed

This role definition exists to prevent:

- Scrum Masters functioning without authority
- Delivery issues discovered too late to act
- Retrospectives without ownership or outcomes
- Teams committing without readiness
- Leadership making decisions based on unreliable data

---

## Relationship to Other Roles

The Scrum Master:

- Partners with the **Product Owner** on backlog quality and prioritization
- Partners with **Engineering leadership** on capacity, quality, and sustainability
- Escalates to **program or portfolio leadership** when systemic issues persist

Collaboration is expected, but **accountability remains clear**.

---

## When This Role Is Most Critical

The enterprise Scrum Master role is especially critical when:

- Delivery predictability is low
- Dependencies are complex or unmanaged
- Teams operate under regulatory or audit constraints
- Leadership confidence in delivery is eroding
- Multiple teams must align on shared outcomes

---

## Key Message

In enterprise environments, the Scrum Master is a **guardian of delivery discipline**.

When empowered and applied correctly, the role enables:
- Predictable delivery
- Early risk detection
- Sustainable team performance
- Executive confidence

When reduced to facilitation alone, Scrum becomes ineffective.
