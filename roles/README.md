# Enterprise Scrum Roles & Accountability

Enterprise-grade role definitions establishing clear accountability
boundaries across Product, Engineering, and Delivery leadership.

These standards exist to prevent role ambiguity, delivery paralysis,
and accountability gaps that commonly occur in large-scale organizations.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to define **how Scrum roles operate in enterprise environments** where:

- Decision authority is distributed
- Dependencies are unavoidable
- Governance and compliance exist
- Delivery commitments matter

Roles are treated as **accountability boundaries**, not job titles.

---

## Enterprise Role Principles

All Scrum roles defined in this playbook adhere to the following principles:

- Clear ownership of decisions
- Single-threaded accountability
- Outcome ownership over activity tracking
- Explicit authority aligned to responsibility
- Collaboration without dilution of ownership

When accountability is shared, it is usually lost.

---

## Roles Covered

This section defines enterprise-grade accountability for the following roles:

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for **value realization and backlog integrity**.

In enterprise environments, this includes:
- Clear prioritization authority
- Stakeholder alignment and expectation management
- Backlog readiness and refinement discipline
- Trade-off decisions under constraints

Refer to `product-owner.md` for detailed responsibilities and expectations.

---

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is accountable for **delivery system health and execution discipline**.

In enterprise environments, this includes:
- Enforcing Definition of Ready and Done
- Facilitating delivery-critical events
- Escalating systemic impediments
- Protecting team focus while enabling transparency
- Acting as a delivery leader, not a meeting coordinator

Refer to `scrum-master.md` for detailed responsibilities and expectations.

---

### Engineering Leadership

Engineering leadership is accountable for **technical execution, quality, and sustainability**.

In enterprise environments, this includes:
- Technical standards and quality practices
- Capacity realism and staffing alignment
- Technical debt management
- Release readiness and production stability

Engineering leadership partners with Product and Delivery but retains
clear accountability for technical outcomes.

---

## Common Enterprise Role Anti-Patterns Addressed

These role standards explicitly prevent the following failure modes:

- Product Owners acting as backlog administrators without authority
- Scrum Masters functioning as coordinators without delivery leverage
- Engineering managers absorbing accountability without empowerment
- Delivery issues escalated without ownership clarity
- Decision paralysis caused by consensus-driven ownership

---

## How These Role Standards Are Used

These role definitions are applied:

- During Scrum team formation or reset
- When delivery accountability is unclear
- During Agile transformation remediation
- To support audit or compliance readiness
- To standardize expectations across teams or programs

Role clarity is enforced **before** process optimization.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams operating with these role standards should observe:

- Faster decision-making
- Reduced delivery friction
- Clear escalation paths
- Improved Sprint predictability
- Stronger leadership trust in delivery commitments

---

## Relationship to Other Playbook Sections

These role standards work in conjunction with:

- `facilitation-guides/` — defines how accountability is exercised in events
- `scrum-events/` — defines execution expectations per event
- `standards/` — defines readiness and completion criteria

Roles define **who owns outcomes**.  
Standards define **what is acceptable**.  
Facilitation defines **how accountability is enforced**.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, **role clarity is non-negotiable**.

Without it:
- Delivery becomes chaotic
- Accountability becomes political
- Predictability becomes impossible

These standards exist to prevent that.
