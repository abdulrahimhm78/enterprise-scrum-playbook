# Sprint Planning (Enterprise Commitment Standard)

Sprint Planning is a **delivery commitment and risk alignment event** that
establishes what the team can realistically deliver in the Sprint,
based on capacity, readiness, and known constraints.

In enterprise environments, Sprint Planning defines a **trust boundary**
between the team and leadership.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Sprint Planning is to:

- Establish a clear and achievable Sprint Goal
- Align scope to actual team capacity
- Confirm readiness of planned work
- Surface risks and dependencies early
- Create a shared delivery commitment

Planning that ignores constraints creates false confidence.

---

## Required Inputs

Sprint Planning must not proceed without the following inputs:

- Prioritized and refined backlog items
- Enforced Definition of Ready (DoR)
- Realistic team capacity (including PTO, support, and interruptions)
- Known dependencies and delivery risks
- Availability of key decision-makers

If these inputs are missing, commitments are invalid.

---

## Enterprise Planning Focus Areas

Sprint Planning must explicitly address:

- **Sprint Goal clarity** — why this work matters
- **Capacity realism** — what can actually be done
- **Readiness validation** — no unready work pulled
- **Risk and dependency visibility**
- **Scope trade-offs** under constraints

Optimism is not a planning strategy.

---

## Commitment Rules

The following rules apply to Sprint commitments:

- The team commits only to work that meets DoR
- Capacity constraints override external pressure
- Scope is adjusted before commitments are made
- Risks are acknowledged, not hidden
- Commitments are owned collectively by the team

A commitment made under pressure is not a commitment.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Effective Sprint Planning produces:

- A clear and measurable Sprint Goal
- A realistic and achievable Sprint Backlog
- Transparent risks and dependencies
- Shared understanding across the team
- Increased confidence in delivery outcomes

---

## Signals of Poor Planning

The following signals indicate Sprint Planning failure:

- Chronic Sprint carryover
- Sprint Goals that are vague or absent
- Work entering the Sprint without DoR
- Capacity ignored or overridden
- Risks discovered mid-Sprint

These are planning failures, not execution failures.

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

This standard explicitly prevents:

- Overcommitting to satisfy stakeholders
- Treating Sprint Planning as a status update
- Pulling work to “fill capacity”
- Ignoring known dependencies
- Allowing unready work into the Sprint

---

## Relationship to Other Events

Sprint Planning sets the foundation for:

- **Daily Scrum** — execution alignment
- **Sprint Review** — value validation
- **Sprint Retrospective** — improvement feedback

Weak planning degrades all downstream events.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, Sprint Planning is a **contract of trust**.

When executed correctly, it enables:
- Predictable delivery
- Transparent risk management
- Sustainable execution

When rushed or pressured, it creates delivery debt that surfaces later as failure.
