# Daily Scrum (Enterprise Execution Alignment)

The Daily Scrum is a **team-owned execution control event** used to inspect
progress toward the Sprint Goal, detect delivery risk early, and adapt
the plan for the next 24 hours.

In enterprise environments, the Daily Scrum is a **flow and risk inspection point**,
not a status reporting forum.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to:

- Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal
- Identify blockers, risks, and dependencies early
- Coordinate work to maintain flow
- Enable rapid plan adjustment

If no plan changes or risk signals emerge, the event is not serving its purpose.

---

## Ownership and Participation

- The Daily Scrum is owned by the **Developers**
- The Scrum Master ensures discipline and focus
- Product Owners may observe but do not direct

The event exists to support **team execution**, not management oversight.

---

## Enterprise Focus Areas

Daily Scrums in enterprise environments must explicitly focus on:

- Progress toward the Sprint Goal (not individual task completion)
- Work in progress (WIP) and flow health
- Blockers and risks that could impact commitments
- Dependencies within and outside the team
- Immediate coordination needs

Individual status updates are delivery anti-patterns.

---

## Execution Standards

The Daily Scrum must adhere to the following standards:

- Time-boxed and consistently scheduled
- Prepared participation by all Developers
- Discussion anchored to the Sprint Goal
- Explicit identification of blockers and risks
- Clear next-24-hour plan adjustments

Deep problem-solving occurs **after** the event with the right participants.

---

## Signals to Escalate

The following signals must trigger immediate escalation:

- Repeated blockers without resolution
- Work stagnating across multiple days
- Sprint Goal risk not acknowledged
- Dependencies not being actively managed
- Unplanned work displacing committed work

Silence in the presence of risk is a failure mode.

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

This standard explicitly prevents:

- Status reporting to the Scrum Master
- Reporting progress to managers
- Problem-solving without decision-makers
- Ignoring blockers until late in the Sprint
- Treating the Daily Scrum as optional

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams using this Daily Scrum standard should observe:

- Faster detection of delivery risks
- Reduced Sprint surprises
- Improved flow and WIP control
- Clearer Sprint Goal focus
- Higher confidence in commitments

---

## Relationship to Other Scrum Events

The Daily Scrum works in conjunction with:

- **Sprint Planning** — sets the commitment
- **Sprint Review** — validates delivered value
- **Sprint Retrospective** — improves execution discipline

Weak Daily Scrums undermine all other events.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, the Daily Scrum is a **delivery early-warning system**.

When executed correctly, it enables:
- Timely intervention
- Predictable delivery
- Sustainable execution

When reduced to status reporting, it provides false confidence and late surprises.
