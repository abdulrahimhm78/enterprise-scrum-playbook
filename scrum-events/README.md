# Scrum Events (Enterprise Execution Standards)

Enterprise-grade execution standards for Scrum events, designed to ensure
predictable delivery, early risk detection, and reliable decision-making
in large-scale and regulated environments.

Scrum events are treated as **delivery control points**, not calendar rituals.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to define **how Scrum events must be executed**
to support enterprise delivery outcomes.

These standards ensure that Scrum events:
- Enable informed decisions
- Surface risks and dependencies early
- Reinforce accountability
- Produce observable delivery signals

Events that do not change delivery behavior are considered ineffective.

---

## Enterprise Event Principles

All Scrum events defined in this section adhere to the following principles:

- Preparation is mandatory
- Outcomes matter more than attendance
- Decisions must be explicit
- Risks and blockers must be surfaced
- Follow-through is required

Scrum events without preparation or outcomes are delivery anti-patterns.

---

## Events Covered

This section defines execution standards for the following Scrum events:

### Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning establishes **realistic commitments** based on capacity,
readiness, and known constraints.

Standards include:
- Enforced Definition of Ready (DoR)
- Capacity-based planning
- Dependency and risk identification
- Clear Sprint Goal articulation
- Commitment realism over optimism

Refer to `sprint-planning.md` for detailed execution guidance.

---

### Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a **flow inspection and risk detection event**, not a status meeting.

Standards include:
- Focus on progress toward the Sprint Goal
- Identification of blockers and risks
- Coordination across dependencies
- Avoidance of reporting to the Scrum Master

Refer to `daily-scrum.md` for detailed execution guidance.

---

### Sprint Review
The Sprint Review is a **value validation checkpoint**, not a demo session.

Standards include:
- Validation against Definition of Done (DoD)
- Stakeholder feedback tied to outcomes
- Release readiness assessment
- Transparency into delivery confidence

Refer to `sprint-review.md` for detailed execution guidance.

---

### Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is a **continuous improvement control mechanism**.

Standards include:
- Root-cause analysis over surface symptoms
- Actionable improvement items
- Ownership assignment
- Follow-through tracking

Refer to `sprint-retrospective.md` for detailed execution guidance.

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

These standards explicitly correct common failure modes, including:

- Sprint Planning driven by optimism instead of readiness
- Daily Scrums devolving into status reporting
- Reviews focused on demos instead of value validation
- Retrospectives without measurable improvement
- Repeated issues without ownership or resolution

---

## How These Standards Are Used

These event standards are applied:

- During Scrum team launch or reset
- When delivery predictability degrades
- As part of Agile maturity remediation
- To standardize execution across teams
- During audit or compliance readiness efforts

Standards may be tailored, but **event discipline is not optional**.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams operating with these event standards should observe:

- Improved Sprint commitment reliability
- Earlier identification of delivery risks
- Reduced unplanned work and carryover
- Higher-quality stakeholder feedback
- Stronger leadership confidence in delivery signals

---

## Relationship to Other Playbook Sections

These event standards work in conjunction with:

- `facilitation-guides/` — defines how events are facilitated
- `roles/` — defines accountability during events
- `standards/` — defines readiness and completion criteria

Events enforce standards.  
Roles enforce accountability.  
Facilitation enforces discipline.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, events exist to **control delivery risk**.

When executed correctly, they enable:
- Predictability
- Transparency
- Timely decisions

When treated as rituals, they create noise and false confidence.

These standards exist to ensure the former.
