# Sprint Review (Value Validation)

## Purpose
The Sprint Review is used to inspect the increment,
validate delivered value, and adapt the backlog based
on stakeholder feedback.

## Key Objectives
- Demonstrate working outcomes
- Gather early feedback
- Align on next priorities
- Maintain transparency on progress

## Good Practices
- Show working product, not slides
- Encourage open discussion
- Discuss both completed and incomplete work

## Common Mistakes
- Treating the review as a demo-only meeting
- Defending scope instead of learning
- Skipping stakeholder feedback
