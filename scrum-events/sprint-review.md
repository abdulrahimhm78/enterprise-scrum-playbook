# Sprint Review (Enterprise Value Validation & Release Readiness)

The Sprint Review is a **value validation and decision checkpoint**
used to inspect the delivered increment, assess readiness for release,
and adapt future plans based on evidence and stakeholder feedback.

In enterprise environments, the Sprint Review exists to **enable decisions**,
not to perform demos.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to:

- Validate delivered value against the Sprint Goal
- Confirm Definition of Done (DoD) adherence
- Assess release readiness and risk
- Gather actionable stakeholder feedback
- Adapt the Product Backlog based on evidence

A review without decisions provides limited value.

---

## Ownership and Participation

- The Product Owner owns **value validation and backlog adaptation**
- The Scrum Master ensures **discipline and outcome focus**
- Developers demonstrate completed increments
- Stakeholders participate to inform decisions

Attendance without engagement is ineffective.

---

## Enterprise Focus Areas

Sprint Reviews in enterprise environments must explicitly address:

- Sprint Goal achievement
- What is **Done** vs. not Done (using DoD)
- Quality, compliance, and non-functional requirements
- Release readiness and remaining risks
- Business impact and outcome alignment
- Backlog reprioritization implications

Slides and narratives without working evidence are anti-patterns.

---

## Execution Standards

The Sprint Review must adhere to the following standards:

- Only **Done** work is demonstrated as complete
- Working increments are shown, not mockups
- Incomplete or blocked work is transparently discussed
- Feedback is captured as backlog inputs
- Decisions and next steps are explicitly stated

Defensive behavior blocks learning.

---

## Decision Outputs

Effective Sprint Reviews produce clear outputs, including:

- Validation or rejection of delivered value
- Updated Product Backlog priorities
- Release or hold decisions
- Identified risks requiring escalation
- Adjusted expectations for upcoming Sprints

If nothing changes after a review, its value is questionable.

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

This standard explicitly prevents:

- Demo-only meetings without discussion
- Defending scope instead of learning
- Demonstrating incomplete or untested work
- Avoiding difficult quality or risk topics
- Excluding decision-makers

---

## Signals of Review Failure

The following signals indicate Sprint Review failure:

- Stakeholders surprised by delivery outcomes
- Repeated quality issues surfacing late
- Backlog not updated after feedback
- No release-related decisions made
- Reviews treated as optional or ceremonial

These are governance failures, not team failures.

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams operating under this standard should observe:

- Earlier validation of value and direction
- Reduced late-stage surprises
- Improved release confidence
- Stronger stakeholder alignment
- Increased leadership trust in delivery signals

---

## Relationship to Other Events

The Sprint Review informs:

- **Sprint Planning** — scope and commitment adjustments
- **Daily Scrum** — execution focus
- **Sprint Retrospective** — improvement focus

Weak reviews create false confidence downstream.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, the Sprint Review is a **decision-enabling control point**.

When executed correctly, it enables:
- Evidence-based planning
- Confident release decisions
- Strong alignment between delivery and business

When reduced to demos, it delays learning and increases risk.
