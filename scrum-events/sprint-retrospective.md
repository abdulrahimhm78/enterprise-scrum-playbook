# Sprint Retrospective (Enterprise Continuous Improvement Standard)

The Sprint Retrospective is a **governed continuous improvement event**
used to inspect delivery performance and implement measurable improvements
in how the team works.

In enterprise environments, retrospectives exist to **change delivery behavior**,
not to discuss feelings or restate known problems.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

- Identify systemic delivery issues
- Perform root-cause analysis
- Define actionable improvement experiments
- Assign ownership and timelines
- Ensure follow-through in subsequent Sprints

Insights without action provide no value.

---

## Ownership and Accountability

- The Scrum Master owns **retrospective effectiveness**
- The team owns **improvement execution**
- Leadership removes systemic impediments when escalated

Improvement without accountability is optional behavior.

---

## Enterprise Focus Areas

Retrospectives must focus on **delivery-impacting factors**, including:

- Sprint Goal achievement and misses
- Flow efficiency and WIP management
- Quality and rework drivers
- Dependency and coordination issues
- Planning and estimation effectiveness
- Tooling, process, and environment constraints

Personality-driven discussions are delivery anti-patterns.

---

## Execution Standards

The Sprint Retrospective must adhere to the following standards:

- Psychological safety is mandatory
- Root causes are identified, not symptoms
- Improvements are small, testable, and specific
- Each action item has a clear owner
- Actions have an expected outcome and review point

If actions are not reviewed, improvement has failed.

---

## Improvement Commitment Rules

The following rules apply to improvement commitments:

- No more than 1–3 improvement actions per Sprint
- Actions must be visible and tracked
- Improvements must be revisited in the next Retrospective
- Systemic issues are escalated, not ignored

Improvement debt accumulates just like technical debt.

---

## Signals of Retrospective Failure

The following signals indicate retrospective failure:

- Repeating the same issues every Sprint
- Action items without owners
- Improvements never reviewed
- Discussions without decisions
- Blame-oriented conversations

These are governance failures, not team failures.

---

## Common Enterprise Anti-Patterns Addressed

This standard explicitly prevents:

- Retrospectives as complaint sessions
- Large improvement backlogs with no execution
- Avoiding difficult systemic topics
- Treating improvement actions as optional
- Lack of leadership escalation when required

---

## Expected Outcomes

Teams operating under this standard should observe:

- Measurable delivery improvements over time
- Reduced recurrence of known issues
- Stronger ownership and accountability
- Increased team maturity
- Greater leadership confidence in continuous improvement

---

## Relationship to Other Events

The Sprint Retrospective informs:

- **Sprint Planning** — improving readiness and commitments
- **Daily Scrum** — improving execution discipline
- **Sprint Review** — improving value delivery

Without retrospectives, Scrum stagnates.

---

## Key Message

In enterprise Scrum, the Sprint Retrospective is a **delivery improvement engine**.

When executed correctly, it enables:
- Sustained performance gains
- Reduced delivery risk
- Strong accountability culture

When treated casually, it becomes noise without impact.
