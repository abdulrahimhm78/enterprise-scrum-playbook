# Sprint Retrospective (Continuous Improvement)

## Purpose
The Sprint Retrospective enables the team to inspect
how the sprint went and identify actionable improvements
for the next sprint.

## Focus Areas

- What slowed delivery
- What should be improved next

## Good Practices

- Assign ownership to action items

## Common Mistakes

- Treating action items as optional
- Turning retrospectives into complaint sessions
